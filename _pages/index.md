Hello there! My name is Manav Batavia.

Iâ€™m a final year student in the Mathematics department at IIT Bombay. I am broadly interested in the fields of **algebra** and **number theory**.

In my spare time, I can probably be found playing, watching or analysing a sport; usually cricket, football or tennis. I also enjoy watching sitcoms and reading fictional thrillers. 

My CV can be found [here]({{site.url}}/cv).
