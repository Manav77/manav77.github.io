## Introduction

Over the years, I have come across a few tricks/hacks for macOS which speed up my workflow. This post is a random list
of such hacks. I discovered most of them on various websites. I’ll add links to such webpages wherever necessary.

## List of hacks

* Cutting a file/folder is one of the most basic operation when it comes to file management. Unfortunately, macOs does
not implement Cmd-X to cut. Instead, you can copy using the regular Cmd-C shortcut and paste using Option-Cmd-V
(instead of Cmd-V which simply copies the file/folder)

* Use Cmd-Shift-. to show hidden files/folders. The same shortcut will again hide the hidden files.

* Drag and drop a file/folder into the file selector menu to quickly navigate and choose the desired file/folder. Useful when opening/uploading files or folders.

* Ubuntu has a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Alt-T) for launching a Terminal window with the currently highlighted
directory as the working directory. One can do this on macOS by heading to:

    System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services -> Files and Folders -> New Terminal at Folder

Assign a keyboard shortcut of your choice. I currently have Shift-Cmd-B.

The only pitfall is that you need to highlight a folder in Finder before pressing the combination. Hence, to open a Terminal in the current folder, hit Cmd+Up to open the parent directory and then use the shortcut.

* To get the complete file path of a file/folder, right click on the file/folder name at the bottom of the Finder
window and choose “Copy * as Pathname"

In the above example, the following path is copied to the clipboard:
/Users/mithileshvaidya/Desktop/tinker.py

* To quickly create an empty file, follow [these](https://medium.com/@a.m./create-shortcut-for-new-txt-or-any-file-in-osx-99df9973239) instructions.
It is analogous to the ‘Create New Document’ functionality in Ubuntu, which is available with a right-click in the file explorer.
