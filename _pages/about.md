Hello there! My name is Mithilesh Vaidya. Iâ€™m a third year student in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Bombay. I plan to use this website as a medium for sharing my projects and other random thoughts.

I was part of Autonise AI, a small group of machine learning enthusiasts during my sophomore year.
We worked on 2 projects:
* Semantic Segmentation
* Text Detection and Recognition

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Preeti Rao](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/prao) on a project called Keyword Spotting.

I also interned at APT Portoflio, a high-frequency trading firm, during the summer of 2020.

In my free time, I enjoy reading [books]({{site.url}}/books) and playing [tennis]({{site.url}}/tennis)
