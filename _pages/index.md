Hello there! My name is Manav Batavia. 

Iâ€™m a fourth year student in the Ph.D. programme at the Department of Mathematics at Purdue University. I am broadly interested in the fields of **commutative algebra** and **algebraic geometry**. My advisors are Prof. [Linquan Ma](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~ma326/) and Prof. [Uli Walther](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~walther/). I am currently working on arithmetic rank and local cohomology computations.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton and board games, watching cricket and tennis, and listening to a wide variety of music. I also enjoy watching sitcoms and reading fictional thrillers. 

My CV can be found [here]({{site.url}}/cv).
