Hello there! My name is Mithilesh Vaidya. I’m a fourth year student in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Bombay.

I am broadly interested in the fields of **Machine Learning** and **Speech Processing**.

I plan to use this website as a medium for sharing my projects and other random thoughts.

If in a hurry, you can have a look at my [CV]({{site.url}}/cv).

I blog about my experiences [here]({{site.url}}/blog.html).
